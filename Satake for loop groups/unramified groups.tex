            \begin{definition}[Jet spaces] \label{def: jet_spaces}
                If $X$ is a scheme over some commutative ring $k$ then we shall denote by $X[t]/t^n$ its associated \textbf{$n^{th}$ jet space}, which is the presheaf on $\Sch_{/\Spec k}^{\aff}$ given by $\Spec R \mapsto X(\Spec R[t]/t^n)$.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}[Loop spaces] \label{def: loop_spaces}
                If $X$ is a scheme over a commutative ring $k$ then its associated \textbf{positive loop space} $X[\![t]\!]$ shall be the presheaf on $\Sch_{/\Spec k}^{\aff}$ given by $\Spec R \mapsto X(\Spf R[\![t]\!])$. Furthermore, the \textbf{loop space} associated to $X$, which we denote by $X(\!(t)\!)$, shall be the presheaf on $\Sch_{/\Spec k}^{\aff}$ given by $\Spec R \mapsto X(\Spec R(\!(t)\!))$.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}
                It is easy to see - using the fact that hom-functors preserve limits - that $X[\![t]\!] \cong \underset{n \in \N}{\lim} X[t]/t^{n + 1}$ for all $k$-schemes $X$, with the $\N$-cofiltered limit here being taken in the presheaf topos over the small fpqc site of $\Spec k$. As such, should $X$ is be of finite type over $\Spec k$, the associated positive loop space $X[\![t]\!]$ shall be of pro-finite type over $\Spec k$: in particular, this means that positive loop spaces of algebraic groups are of pro-finite type.
            \end{remark}
            The following is a technical result, necessary for the establishment of the affine Grassmannian for connected reductive groups $G$ as the fpqc quotient $G(\!(t)\!)/G[\![t]\!]$.
            \begin{proposition}[Loop spaces are fpqc sheaves] \label{prop: loop_spaces_are_fpqc_sheaves}
                Let $X$ be a scheme over finite type over a field $k$. Then, both $X[\![t]\!]$ and $X(\!(t)\!)$ will satisfy fpqc descent. 
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                        
                \end{proof}
            
            \begin{definition}[Integral lattices] \label{def: integral_lattices}
                Let $k$ be a commutative ring. A \textbf{$k$-integral lattice} of rank $n \geq 1$ is thus a finite and Zariski-locally free $k[\![t]\!]$-submodule $\Lambda \subseteq k(\!(t)\!)^{\oplus n}$ such that $\Lambda \tensor_{k[\![t]\!]} k(\!(t)\!) \cong k(\!(t)\!)^{\oplus n}$. 
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}[The affine Grassmannian for $\GL_n$] \label{def: the_affine_grassmannian_for_GLn}
                Let $k$ be a commutative ring and fix a positive integer $n \geq 1$. The \textbf{affine Grassmannian} associated to the connected reductive group $k$-scheme $(\GL_n)_k$, denoted by $\Gr_{\GL_n/k}$ (or $\Gr_{\GL_n}$ when $k$ is clearly understood from the context) or simply $\Gr_n$, is defined to be the presheaf on $\Sch_{/\Spec k}^{\aff}$ given by $\Spec R \mapsto \left\{ \text{ $R$-integral lattices $\Lambda \subseteq R(\!(t)\!)^{\oplus n}$ } \right\}$.
            \end{definition}
            Now, one of the most important properties of the affine Grassmannian for $\GL_n$ is that it is an ind-proper formal scheme. In order to show that it is so, however, we shall need to introduce a preliminary construction: that of truncated affine Grassmannians. 
            \begin{definition}[Truncated affine Grassmannians] \label{def: truncated_affine_grassmannians}
                Fix a commutative ring $k$. For any pair of integers $a \leq b$, denote by $\Gr_{[a, b]}$ for the subfunctor of $\Gr_n$ (and note that $\Gr_n = \Gr_{[0, n]}$) given by $\Spec R \mapsto \left\{ \Lambda \in \Gr_n(R) \mid t^a R[\![t]\!]^{\oplus n} \subseteq \Lambda \subseteq t^b R[\![t]\!]^{\oplus n} \right\}$ and called the \textbf{$[a, b]$-truncated affine Grassmannian} associated to $\GL_n$ over $\Spec k$.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{proposition}[Truncated Grassmannians are proper] \label{prop: truncated_grassmannians_are_proper}
                Over any commutative ring $k$, the truncated Grassmannian $\Gr_{[a, b]}$ over $\Spec k$ as in definition \ref{def: truncated_affine_grassmannians} is a proper scheme over $\Spec k$.
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                    
                \end{proof}
            \begin{proposition}[The colimit over truncated Grassmannians] \label{prop: the_colimit_over_truncated_grassmannians}
                Let $k$ be an arbitrary commutative ring. Then, we have an isomorphism of fpqc sheaves over $\Spec k$ as follows (wherein $\simp[1]$ denotes the $1$-simplex $\{0 \to 1\}$, which we shall view as a filtered category), wherein the transition morphisms are closed immersions of $k$-schemes:
                    $$\Gr_n \cong \underset{ [a, b] \in \N^{\simp[1]} }{\colim} \Gr_{[a, b]}$$
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                        
                \end{proof}
            \begin{corollary}
                Let $k$ be a commutative ring. Then, the affine Grassmannian $\Gr_{\GL_n/k}$ is an ind-proper formal scheme over $\Spec k$.
            \end{corollary}
            \begin{corollary}[The affine Grassmannian for $\GL_n$ is an fpqc sheaf] \label{lemma: the_affine_grassmannian_for_GLn_is_an_fpqc_sheaf}
                Let $k$ be a commutative ring and fix a positive integer $n \geq 1$. Then the affine Grassmannian $\Gr_{\GL_n/k}$ as in definition \ref{def: the_affine_grassmannian_for_GLn} is a sheaf on the small fpqc site of $\Spec k$.
            \end{corollary}
            \begin{remark}[Actions of loop groups on affine Grassmannians] \label{remark: actions_of_loop_groups_on_affine_grassmannians}
                Let $k$ be a commutative ring and consider the affine Grassmannian $\Gr_{/\GL_n/k}$. Observe that there is always a canonically induced $\GL_n[\![t]\!]$-action on $\Gr_{\GL_n/k}$ given by $(g, \Lambda) \mapsto ()$
            \end{remark}
            \begin{proposition}[]
